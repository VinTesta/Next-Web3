1. Array Subsets

Given an integer array, divide the array Into 2 subsets A and B while
respecting the following conditions :

«The Intersection of Aand B is null.

* The union Aand B is equal to the original array.

* The number of elements In subset A Is minimal.

* The sum of A's elements Is greater than the sum of B's elements.

Return the subset A In Increasing order where the sum of A's
elements Is greater than the sum of B's elements. If more than one
subset exists, return the one with the maximal sum.

Example
n=5
arr=(3,7,56,2]

The 2 subsets In arr that satisfy the conditions for Aare [5, 7] and
16,7]:

* Als minimal (size 2)

« SumA)=(5+7)=12>5um(B)=(2+3+6)= 11
 sum(A)=(6+7)=13>Sum(B)=(2+3+5)= 10

« Thelntersection of A and B Is null and their union Is equal to arr.
* The subset A where the sum of its elements is maximal Is [6, 7).

Function Description
Complete the subsetA function in the editor below.

subsetA has the following parameter(s):
int arr{]: an integer array

Returns:
int[]: an Integer array with the values of subset A.
